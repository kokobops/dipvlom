# Дипломное задание по курсу «DevOps-инженер»

## Этапы выполнения:

### 1. Регистрация доменного имени

Зарегистрировал на nic.ru доменное имя dipvlom.ru и создал dns запись на хостинге
(сначала каждый раз при создании вносил ip адрес в днс, но ждать распространения зоны относстельно долго, поэтому арендовал ip адрес в облаке и после поднятия инфраструктуры менял его руками на статический)
